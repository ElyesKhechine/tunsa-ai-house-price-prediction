# TUNSA AI: House Price Prediction
A repository containing a Jupyter notebook and a dataset for a mini-project entitled "House Prices Prediction" I worked on within subteam 3 of TUNSA's AI team.

Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn

The goal of this project is to build a Linear Regression model using a Python test-driven approach, then deploying the trained model to predict house sale prices.
